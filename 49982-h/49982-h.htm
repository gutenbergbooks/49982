<h2 id="c3">THE YELLOW-BELLIED FLYCATCHER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Empidonax flaviventris.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Yellow-bellied Flycatcher with the
kingbird, the phoebe and the wood pewee
belongs to a family of birds peculiar to
America&mdash;the family Tyrannid&aelig; or the
family of tyrants. No better name could
be applied to these birds when we take
into consideration the enormous number
of insects, of all descriptions, that they
capture and devour and their method of
doing it. They resemble the hawks in
some respects. They are at home only
where there are trees, on the outer
branches of which they can perch and
await a passing insect, and when one appears
they &ldquo;launch forth into the air;
there is a sharp, suggestive click of the
broad bill and, completing their aerial
circle, they return to their perch and are
again en garde.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the tropics, the land of luxuriant
vegetable growth, where the number and
kinds of insects seem almost innumerable,
the larger number of the three hundred
and fifty known species are found. In
the United States we are favored with
the visits, during the warmer months, of
but thirty-five species of these interesting
and useful birds.</p>
<p>As we would naturally expect of birds
of prey, whether hunters of insects or of
higher animal life, these birds are not
usually social, even with their own kind.
They are also practically songless, a characteristic
which seems perfectly fitted to
the habits of the Flycatchers. Some of
the species have sweet-voiced calls. This
is the case with the wood pewee, of which
Trowbridge has so beautifully written in
the following verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Long-drawn and clear its closes were&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">As if the hand of Music through</p>
<p class="t">The sombre robe of Silence drew</p>
<p class="t0">A thread of golden gossamer;</p>
<p class="t">So pure a flute the fairy blew.</p>
<p class="t0">Like beggared princes of the wood,</p>
<p class="t0">In silver rags the birches stood;</p>
<p class="t0">The hemlocks, lordly counselors,</p>
<p class="t0">Were dumb; the sturdy servitors,</p>
<p class="t0">In beechen jackets patched and gray,</p>
<p class="t0">Seemed waiting spellbound all the day</p>
<p class="t">That low, entrancing note to hear&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Pe-wee! pe-wee! peer!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Flycatchers are fitted both in the
structure of their bills and in the colors
of their plumage for the kind of life that
they live. The bills are broad and flat,
permitting an extensive gape. They live
in trees and are usually plainly colored,
either a grayish or greenish olive, being
not so easily seen by the insects as if
more brightly arrayed. This characteristic
is known as deceptive coloration.</p>
<p>The Yellow-bellied Flycatcher has its
summer home in eastern North America,
breeding from Massachusetts northward
to Labrador. In the United States it frequents
only the forests of the northern
portion and the mountain regions. In the
winter it passes southward into Mexico
and Central America. Like all the Flycatchers
of North America, the very
nature of its food necessitates extensive
migrations.</p>
<p>Its generic name is very suggestive. It
is Empidonax, from two Greek words,
meaning mosquito and a prince&mdash;Mosquito
Prince!</p>
<p>Major Bendire says: &ldquo;In the Adirondack
mountains, where I have met with
it, it was observed only in primitive
mixed and rather open woods, where the
ground was thickly strewn with decaying,
moss-covered logs and boles, and almost
constantly shaded from the rays of
the sun. The most gloomy looking
places, fairly reeking with moisture,
where nearly every inch of ground is covered
with a luxuriant carpet of spagnum
moss, into which one sinks several inches
at every step, regions swarming with
mosquitoes and black flies, are the localities
that seem to constitute their favorite
summer haunts.&rdquo; Surely the name Empidonax
is most appropriate.</p>

<p>The nest is usually constructed on upturned
roots near the ground, or on the
ground deeply imbedded in the long
mosses. A nest belonging to the National
Museum is thus described: &ldquo;The primary
foundation of the nest was a layer of
brown rootlets; upon this rested the bulk
of the structure, consisting of moss
matted together with fine broken weed
stalks and other fragmentary material.
The inner nest could be removed entire
from the outer wall, and was composed
of a loosely woven but, from its thickness,
somewhat dense fabric of fine materials,
consisting mainly of the bleached
stems of some slender sedge and the
black and shining rootlets of ferns, closely
resembling horsehair. Between the two
sections of the structure and appearing
only when they were separated, was a
scant layer of the glossy orange pedicels
of a moss not a fragment of which was
elsewhere visible. The walls of the internal
nest were about one-half an inch
in thickness and had doubtless been accomplished
with a view of protection
from dampness.&rdquo; The nests are sometimes
made of dried grasses interwoven
with various mosses and lined with moss
and fine black wire-like roots. Again,
the birds seem to have an eye for color
and will face the outside of the nest with
fresh and bright green moss. In every
way the nest seems a large house for so
small a bird.</p>
<p>To study this Flycatcher &ldquo;one must
seek the northern evergreen forests,
where, far from human habitations, its
mournful notes blend with the murmur
of some icy brook tumbling over mossy
stones or gushing beneath the still mossier
decayed logs that threaten to bar the
way. Where all is green and dark and
cool, in some glen overarched by crowding
spruces and firs, birches and maples,
there it is we find him and in the beds of
damp moss he skillfully conceals his
nest.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Like a bee with its honey, when the
Ruby-crown has unloaded his vocal
sweetness, there is comparatively little
left of him, and, ebullient with an energy
that would otherwise rend him, his incredible
vocal achievement is the safety valve
that has so far preserved his atoms in
their Avian semblance.</p>
<p>Dr. Coues says that his lower larynx,
the sound-producing organ, is not much
bigger than a good-sized pin&rsquo;s head, and
the muscles that move it are almost microscopic
shreds of flesh. &ldquo;If the strength
of the human voice were in the same proportion
to the size of the larynx, we
could converse with ease at a distance of
a mile or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kinglet&rsquo;s exquisite vocalization,&rdquo;
he continues, &ldquo;defies description; we can
only speak in general terms of the power,
purity and volume of the notes, their
faultless modulation and long continuance.
Many doubtless, have listened to
this music without suspecting that the author
was the diminutive Ruby-crown,
with whose commonplace utterance, the
slender, wiry &lsquo;tsip,&rsquo; they were already familiar.
This delightful role, of musician,
is chiefly executed during the mating season,
and the brief period of exaltation
which precedes it. It is consequently seldom
heard in regions where the bird does
not rear its young, except when the little
performer breaks forth in song on nearing
its summer resorts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Rev. J. H. Langille heard his
first Regulus calendula, he said, &ldquo;The
song came from out of a thick clump of
thorns, and was so loud and spirited that
I was led to expect a bird at least as large
as a thrush. Chee-oo, chee-oo, chee-oo,
choo, choo, tseet, tseet, te-tseet, te-tseet,
te-tseet, etc., may represent this wonderful
melody, the first notes being strongly
palatal and somewhat aspirated,
the latter slender and sibilant and more
rapidly uttered; the first part being
also so full and animated as to make one
think of the water-thrush, or the winter
wren; while the last part sounded like
a succeedant song from a slender-voiced
warbler. Could all this come from the
throat of this tiny, four-inch Sylvia? I
was obliged to believe my own eyes, for I
saw the bird many times in the act of
singing. The melody was such as to
mark the day on which I heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>H. D. Minot says, &ldquo;In autumn and winter
their only note is a feeble lisp. In
spring, besides occasionally uttering an
indescribable querulous sound, and a
harsh, &lsquo;grating&rsquo; note, which belongs exclusively
to that season, the Ruby-crowned
wrens sing extremely well and
louder than such small birds seem capable
of singing. Their song begins with
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
a few clear whistles, followed by a short,
very sweet, and complicated warble, and
ending with notes like the syllables
tu-we-we, tu-we-we, tu-we-we. These
latter are often repeated separately, as
if the birds had no time for a prelude, or
are sometimes prefaced by merely a few
rather shrill notes with a rising inflection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Messrs. Baird, Brewer and Ridgway
say that &ldquo;The song of this bird is by far
the most remarkable of its specific peculiarities,&rdquo;
and Mr. Chapman declares,
&ldquo;Taking the small size of the bird into
consideration, the Ruby-crown&rsquo;s song is
one of the most marvellous vocal performances
among birds; being not only
surpassingly sweet, varied and sustained,
but possessed of sufficient volume to be
heard at a distance of two hundred yards.
Fortunately he sings both on the spring
and fall migrations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wright describes the call-note
as &ldquo;Thin and metallic, like a vibrating
wire,&rdquo; and quotes Mr. Nehrling, who
speaks of the &ldquo;Power, purity and volume
of the notes, their faultless modulation
and long continuance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Ridgway wrote that this
little king of song was one of our very
smallest birds he also &ldquo;ranks among the
sweetest singers of the country. It is wonderfully
powerful for one so small, but
it is remarkable for its softness and sweet
expression more than for other qualities.
It consists of an inexpressibly delicate
and musical warble, astonishingly protracted
at times, and most beautifully
varied by softly rising and falling cadences,
and the most tender whistlings
imaginable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ridgway quotes from Dr. Brewer:
&ldquo;The notes are clear, resonant and high,
and constitute a prolonged series, varying
from the lowest tones to the highest, and
terminating with the latter. It may be
heard at quite a distance, and in some respects
bears more resemblance to the song
of the English skylark than to that of the
canary, to which Mr. Audubon compares
it.&rdquo; Mr. Ridgway continues: &ldquo;We have
never heard the skylark sing, but there is
certainly no resemblance between the
notes of the Ruby-crowned Kinglet and
those of the canary, the latter being as inferior
in tenderness and softness as they
excel in loudness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Audubon had stated: &ldquo;When I tell
you that its song is fully as sonorous as
that of the canary-bird, and much richer,
I do not come up to the truth, for it is not
only as powerful and clear, but much
more varied and pleasing to the ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the frequent sacrifice of the
adult regulus and regina through their
reckless absorption in their own affairs
and obliviousness to the presence of enemies,
lends color to the statement that
&ldquo;The spirits of the martyrs will be lodged
in the crops of green birds,&rdquo; yet by virtue
of a talent other than vocal, they compel
few of the human family to echo the remorseful
lament of John Halifax, Gentleman,</p>
<div class="verse">

<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h2 id="c7">THE OLIVE-SIDED FLYCATCHER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Contopus borealis.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Olive-sided Flycatcher is a North
American bird breeding in the coniferous
forests of our Northern States, northward
into Canada and in mountainous
regions. It winters in Central and South
America.</p>
<p>Like all Flycatchers, their food consists
almost exclusively of winged insects,
such as beetles, butterflies, moths and the
numerous gadflies which abound in the
places frequented by these birds. A dead
limb or the decayed top of some tall tree
giving a good outlook close to the nesting
site, is usually selected for a perch, from
which excursions are made in different
directions after passing insects, which
are often chased for quite a distance.
This Flycatcher usually arrives on its
breeding grounds about the middle of
May, and its far-reaching call notes can
then be heard almost constantly in the
early morning hours and again in the
Four Birds &amp; Nature Tues&mdash;Hammond
evening. Unless close to the bird, this
note sounds much like that of the wood
pewee, which utters a note of only two
syllables, like &ldquo;pee-wee,&rdquo; while that of the
Olive-sided Flycatcher really consists of
three, like &ldquo;hip-pin-whee.&rdquo; The first
part is uttered short and quick, while the
latter two are so accented and drawn out,
that at a distance the call sounds as if
likewise composed of only two notes, but
this is not the case. Their alarm note
sounds like &ldquo;puip-puip-puip,&rdquo; several
times repeated, or &ldquo;puill-puill-puill;&rdquo; this
is usually given only when the nest is approached,
and occasionally a purring
sound is also uttered.</p>
<p>Tall evergreen trees, such as pines,
hemlocks, spruces, firs and cedars, situated
near the edge of an opening or clearing
in the forest, not too far from
water and commanding a good outlook,
or on a bluff along a stream, a hillside,
the shore of a lake or pond, are usually
selected as nesting sites by this species,
and the nest is generally saddled well out
on one of the limbs, where it is difficult
to see and still more difficult to get at.
Only on rare occasions will this species
nest in a deciduous tree.</p>
<p>While it appears tolerant enough toward
other species, it will not allow any
of its own kind to nest in close proximity
to its chosen home, to which it returns
from year to year. Each pair seems to
claim a certain range, which is rarely less
than half a mile in extent, and is usually
located along some stream, near the shore
of a lake, or by some little pond; generally
coniferous forests are preferred,
but mixed ones answer their purpose almost
equally well as long as they border
on a body of water or a beaver meadow
and have a few clumps of hemlock or
spruce trees scattered through them
which will furnish suitable nesting sites
and lookout perches.</p>
<p>While on a collecting trip a nest of this
species was observed in a spruce tree and
about forty-five feet from the ground.
The birds betrayed the location of the
nest by their excited actions and incessant
scolding. They were very bold, flying
close around the climber&rsquo;s head,
snapping their bills at him, and uttering
angry notes of defiance rather than of distress,
something like &ldquo;puy-pip-pip.&rdquo; They
could not possibly have been more pugnacious.</p>
<p>The nest was a well-built structure.
It was outwardly composed of fine, wiry
roots and small twigs, mixed with green
moss and lined with fine roots and moss.
It was securely fixed among a mass of
fine twigs growing out at that point of
the limb.</p>
<p>As a rule the nests are placed at a considerable
height from the ground, usually
from forty to sixty feet, though occasionally
one is found that is not more than
twenty feet.</p>
<p>In spite of their pugnacious and quarrelsome
habits these birds are so attached
to the localities they have selected for
their homes that they will usually lay a
second set of eggs in the same nest from
which their first set has been taken&mdash;Adapted

<h2 id="c8">THE COMING OF MISS OCTOBER MONTH.</h2>
<p>Over in Farmer Goodman&rsquo;s timber
there was a great stir. Everybody was
busy. All summer the trees had been
planning a picnic reception to be given to
the Month brothers and sisters when the
hot weather had passed.</p>
<p>When it became noised around the
whole neighborhood was delighted with
the thought. Everyone wanted to do
what little he could to help things along.
Several dignified old owls, who had holes
in the trees, promptly offered to chaperone
the party. The cat-tails along the
brook just at the edge of the timber promised
to wear their prettiest head-dresses
if they would be allowed to wait on the
door. The golden rod, purple asters
and other flowers along the road and the
ferns, wahoo, sumac and their companions
agreed to outdo themselves in the
effort to furnish beautiful, tasty decorations.</p>
<p>The refreshments would cost nothing.
The spring at the foot of the hill offered
to supply clear cool drinks for all, free of
charge. They had an abundance of wild
grapes, wild cherries, pawpaws, red haws,
hazel, hickory and other nuts.</p>
<p>Prof. Wind was engaged to have his
band there to furnish music for the dancing.</p>
<p>As it was hoped to make this a long-to-be-remembered
event, all summer was
spent in planning and preparation. Many
were the happy hours passed by the trees
in discussing the styles and colors in
which they were to be decked. Whenever
the band was practicing its new
pieces for the occasion the little leaves
would dance and skip for joy.</p>
<p>The names of Mr. January Month and
all his brothers and sisters, February,
March, April, May, June, July, August,
September, October, November, December
were written on a sheet of paper. The
list was handed to a gay little squirrel,
with a handsome tail and pretty stripes
down his back. He was then given instructions
and sent to do the inviting. A
funny little hop-toad wished to go along.
The squirrel said that he would be pleased
to have company, but he scampered
around from place to place as though he
were going for a doctor for a dying child.
As the little hop-toad could not keep up,
he came home crying.</p>
<p>Fancy the disappointment when the
squirrel brought back word that pretty
Miss October Month was the only one
who had accepted the kind invitation. All
said that they would be delighted to be
there, that they knew that it would be a
very happy, jolly affair; but each month
claimed that having his own work to do
without help he is kept so busy that he
has no time for roving and sport. After
the trees and their friends had so kindly
made such great arrangements for their
entertainment and honor, the narrow-minded
months were not grateful nor polite
enough to even try to manage their
work so that they could get off for a day.
Perhaps they had forgotten that there is
such a thing as fun and rest. Poor
Months! No wonder they die so early!</p>
<p>Every plan for a brilliant event had
been made. Bright, amiable October
came. The day was sunny and warm,
but not hot. Everyone did his part according
to agreement. The common yellow
butterflies, some caterpillars and other
insects who had been in no hurry to
disappear, were there. Although many
of the birds had left for their southern
trip, there were a number of catbirds, hermit
thrushes, brown thrushes, phoebes,
song sparrows and others who furnished
rare solos and grand choruses between
dances. The cowbirds and yellow-bellied
sapsuckers who do not sing wished to do
something, too. The cowbirds offered to
keep the flies and other insects off of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
victuals, and the sapsuckers agreed to
give tapping signals from their high
places in the tall trees whenever a change
of program was to be announced.</p>
<p>A mischievous blue jay made a slight
disturbance by trying to steal some of the
dinner before the table was set. When
Mrs. Chipmunk tried to drive him off, he
showed fight, but in less than a minute
such a crowd had gathered to see what
was the matter that he took flight in great
shame.</p>
<p>Everybody seemed to have fallen in
love with Miss October. The affair was
such a success and the very air was filled
with such good will and jollity, that all
begged and coaxed her to remain for a
visit.</p>
<p>They had no trouble in arranging
amusements for every day. Grandaddy
long legs danced several jigs. The crickets
and the grasshoppers got up a baseball
game. When the baby show came
off, Mrs. Quail took the prize for the prettiest
baby under a year. Mother Pig
who had heard of it and had broken out
of Farmer Goodman&rsquo;s pasture in order
to bring the plumpest of her litter, carried
back the prize for the fattest baby. Mrs.
English Sparrow reported the largest
number of broods raised. The locusts and
the katydids took part in a cake walk.</p>
<p>A great fat young grasshopper and a
young robin entered a hopping race. As
they came out even there was trouble and
prospects of hard feelings. Three butterflies
who were acting as judges decided
to award the prize to the grasshopper because
he was smaller. This decision did
not suit the robin. In a fit of impatience
he ended the matter by swallowing the
grasshopper&mdash;legs and all.</p>
<p>During the moonshiny nights Mr.
Man-in-the-Moon took great pains to
furnish excellent light. On other nights
the fireflies showed their brightest lanterns.</p>
<p>Sometimes at night, white-robed Jack
Frost would come and play kissing games
with the leaves who would then get happier,
more radiant faces. But he would
box and wrestle with the nuts until their
shells would crack open. Then when
they came to play tag or puss-wants-a-corner
with the leaves, as the little West
Wind brothers frequently did, they, in
their rough sport, would knock the nuts
out of their cosy shells upon the ground,
so that the children could pick them up.
Merry times were these!</p>
<p>In this way the sports were carried on
for thirty-one days and nights. By that
time everyone, even Miss October herself,
was tired out. The fine dresses of the
trees being the worse for wear, dropped,
leaf by leaf, and some of the trees were
left nearly naked. The grasshoppers, butterflies
and caterpillars who could no
longer keep their eyes open had dropped
into their winter&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Except the meadow-larks, red winged
blackbirds, robins, blue jays, bluebirds
and a few others the feathered tribes had
been obliged to leave. Some fox sparrows
on their way to the south had
stopped for a few days; but they said that
they could not stay until the festivities
were over.</p>
<p>Finally her mother, Mrs. Year, telegraphed
to Miss October, who did not
know when her welcome was worn out,
bidding her to make her adieux and start
home instantly. Being exhausted from
sleepless days and nights she was glad to
leave.</p>
<p>After her departure, in the timber
everything became quiet and still, but the
trees hoped that sometime in the future
they might have another picnic as delightful
and jolly, and all felt satisfied
and voted the reception a perfect success.</p>

<h2 id="c9">THE TREE SPARROW.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Spizella monticola.</i>)</span></h2>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I like to see them feasting on the seed stalks above the crust, and hear their chorus
of merry tinkling notes, like sparkling frost crystals turned to music.&rdquo;
<span class="lr">&mdash;<i>Chapman.</i></span></p>
<p>One who loves birds cannot fail to be
attracted by the sparrows and especially
by the Tree Sparrow, whose pert form
is the subject of our picture. This little
bird comes to us in the Eastern United
States in September or October and remains
throughout the winter. It is at
this time common or even abundant as
far to the westward as the great plains,
and is rare farther west. It is a winter
bird and breeds in the colder latitudes
north of the United States, where it
builds its home of grasses, shreds of bark
and small roots interlaced with hair, not
high up in trees, as its name might indicate,
but upon or near the ground.</p>
<p>Gentle and of a retiring disposition,
they prefer the cultivated fields, the
meadows, the woods with their borders of
shrubs or the trees of the orchard. Such
is their confidence, however, that they
will even visit the dooryards and prettily
pick up the scattered crumbs or grain.</p>
<p>While tramping through a meadow in
the early winter and before the snow has
disappeared or the frost has hardened and
changed the surface of the earth, the
tramper may frequently disturb numbers
of the sparrows. Flying from the
dried grass they will seem to come out of
the ground. Speaking of such an incident,
Mr. Keyser says: &ldquo;This unexpected
behavior led me to investigate, and
I soon found that in many places there
were cozy apartments hollowed out under
the long thick tufts of grass, with neat
entrances at one side like the door of an
Eskimo hut. These hollows gave ample
evidence of having been occupied by the
birds, so there could be no doubt about
their being bird bed-rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These little birds seem almost a part of
one&rsquo;s animal family, and a companion in
those regions where the snow covers the
ground a part of the year. They chirp
and often sing quite gaily in the spring.
They may often be seen when the thermometer
indicates a temperature below
zero and the snow is a foot or more in
depth. Seemingly all that is required to
satisfy them is a plenty of weeds from
which they may gather the seeds. They
are driven southerly only by a lack of a
suitable food supply. Often they may
be found resting under clumps of tall
grass or vines on which the snow has
gathered, forming a sort of roof over the
snug retreat. &ldquo;Whether rendered careless
by the cold or through a natural
heedlessness, they are very tame at such
times; they sit unconcernedly on the
twigs, it may be but a few feet distant,
chirping cheerfully, with the plumage all
loosened and puffy, making very pretty
roly-poly looking objects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very pretty sight, and one that may
frequently be seen, is a flock of Tree
Sparrows around some tall weed. Some
of the birds will be actively gathering
seeds from the branches of the weed,
while others will stand upon the ground
or snow and pick up those seeds that are
dropped or shaken off by their relatives
above. While thus feeding there seems
to be a constant conversation. If we
could but translate this sweet-voiced
chirping perhaps we should find that they
are expressing to each other the pleasure
that the repast is giving them.</p>

<p>Their song is sweet and pleasing. They
are not constant songsters, but seem to be
moved by some unseen spirit, for a flock
will suddenly burst out in a melody of
song that is entrancing. He who has been
favored with such a concert is indeed
fortunate. Their whole being seems to
be brought into action in the production
of this song, which is &ldquo;somewhat crude
and labored in technique, but the tones
are very sweet indeed, not soft and low
but quite loud and clear. Quite often the
song opens with one or two long syllables
and ends with a merry little trill having
a delightfully human intonation. There
is, indeed, something innocent and child-like
about the voices of these sparrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tree Sparrow is often called the
Winter Chippy and is confounded with
the chipping sparrow, which it resembles.
It is a larger bird and carries a mark of
identification by which it may be easily
known. There is on the grayish white
breast a small black spot. Moreover, the
Tree Sparrow arrives in its winter range
about the time that the chippy retires to
the Gulf States and Mexico.</p>

<h2 id="c11">THE SPARROW FAMILY.</h2>
<p>We all know some of the members of
the Sparrow family, little gray and brown
birds, striped above and lighter underneath.
They belong to the Finch family,
which is the largest of all the bird families.
One-seventh of all the birds belong to
this family. Just think how many uncles
and cousins and aunts the little sparrows
have! They are birds of the ground, not
birds of the trees, like the vireos. They
only choose high perches when they wish
to rest or sing. We see them hunting for
food in the grassy meadows, or fresh-plowed
field, or in the dusty road. They
usually make their nests in low bushes
or on the ground and, as a rule, they fly
only short distances, and do not skim
around just for the fun of it, like the swallows.</p>
<p>There are over forty different kinds of
sparrows in our country.</p>
<p>The English sparrows are found all
over the world. They stay with us all the
year round. We ought to be friendly
with them as we have such a good chance
to become acquainted. They certainly intend
to be friendly with us for they
scarcely fly away at our approach. Mother
Sparrow is a hard worker, raising four
broods every year. Just think how many
children and grand-children one sparrow
can have! English sparrows are called
quarrelsome birds, and I believe it is true
that they have driven away many of the
pretty bluebirds, but we sometimes think
they are quarreling when they are not.
Have you ever noticed a crowd of sparrows
following one bird? I used to think
that they were all quarreling with that
one bird; but no, they follow her because
they admire and like her. Some people
scold a great deal about the harm that
the sparrows do to the fruit and grain.
But think of the many insects that these
birds eat in one year! I believe they do
more good than harm, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>The chipping sparrow often builds its
nest in tall trees. This is the only sparrow
I know of, which builds its nest up
high. This bird is smaller than the English
sparrow. It has a reddish-brown
back and crown. Did you ever hear its
funny little song? It sounds like the buzzing
of a locust. It can call, chip! chip!
too.</p>
<p>The field sparrow is about the same
size as the chipping sparrow and its head
and back are of the same color. As can be
guessed from its name, it is fond of fields
and meadows. The field sparrow sings
very sweetly.</p>
<p>Then there is the fox sparrow, which is
not only the largest of the sparrows, but
the finest singer. It comes about as early
as the bluebird. We often hear its sweet
song in March. It is called the fox sparrow,
not because it is sly like the fox, but
on account of its color which is reddish
like the fox&rsquo;s fur.</p>
<p>The grasshopper sparrow is smaller
than the English sparrow. It has a cry
which sounds like a grasshopper in the
grass.</p>
<p>The song sparrow is one of the commonest
of our birds, staying with us nearly
all the year. The name indicates to us
that it has a sweet voice. It begins to sing
almost as early as the robin and will
sing every hour in the day and seems
never to tire of singing. The song sparrow
is about the same size as the English
sparrow.</p>
<p>Then there are the savanna sparrow
and the seaside sparrow which are fond
of marshes, near the sea; and the white-crowned.
This and the white-throated
sparrows are both fine singers and handsome
birds. They are larger than the
English sparrow. The vesper sparrow
has a fine voice, singing late in the afternoon
and evening. It is as fond of the
meadows as the field sparrow. The two
birds are often taken for each other, but
if the vesper sparrow is watched when it
flies, it will be seen that it has white tail
quills which the field sparrow does not
possess. Both are about the same size.</p>
<p>The winter chippy or tree sparrow is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
winter bird, in the United States appearing
in the fall and flying away early in the
spring. Its name would indicate that it
was fond of trees, but this is not the case,
as it is usually seen on the ground and
even makes its nest there.</p>
<p>There are many other members of the
sparrow family, but this is enough for to-day.
I hope that you will watch them
and try to become acquainted with all.</p>

<h2 id="c12">MR. AND MRS. SPARROW&rsquo;S BLUNDER.</h2>
<p>Many people suppose that the instinct
of birds and animals is never wrong, but
this is a mistake. I have often seen the
wild geese fly north over the western
prairies only to come squawking back in
a few days, to linger with us, if not going
farther south, until the sun warmed
up the northland and they dared another
flight.</p>
<p>Once my brother witnessed a most
amusing case of mistaken judgment
among birds. He had opened a store in
a northern town, and during the month
of March was much discouraged by the
continued cold weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! but spring&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; exclaimed his
partner gleefully one bleak day. &ldquo;See
those sparrows building a nest in our
eaves? That&rsquo;s a sure sign!&rdquo; From that day
on the two young men took great interest
in the new home going up under&mdash;or
rather over&mdash;their very eyes. Each new
bit of rag or straw woven in was noted,
and they even strewed cotton about in
handy places for the birds to use as &ldquo;carpeting
in the mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the weather did not improve, in
spite of the sparrow&rsquo;s prophecy; instead
of that, a sleet set in one night, and
morning saw a most wintry-looking earth.
When the young men went down to open
up the store for business, they heard loud,
really angry, chirping coming from the
eaves. Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow were discussing
something with energy, and
when at last a decision was reached they
both swooped down upon their almost finished
nest and tore it all to pieces. Not
one twig or rag or straw was left in
place. When the destruction was complete
they gave a loud chirp of satisfaction
and flew off together, never to return.</p>
<p>They had simply made a mistake in
their calendar.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<h2 id="c13">A WINDOW-PANE REVERIE.</h2>
<p>I stood by my study window after dark.
An electric light a few blocks distant, cast
shadows of the small limbs of a tree
upon the window-pane. Those shadows
were in constant motion because of the
wind blowing through the trees. Through
the dancing shadows I saw the brilliant
light against the darkness of the western
sky. My breath condensed into moisture
on the cold glass, and through that moisture
the electric light shone in the center
of a brilliantly-colored circle, composed of
myriads of pencils of light, radiating
from the dazzling central point. As the
moisture evaporated the pencils became
fewer and coarser, bright lines and fragments
of lines, rather than pencils. A
few breaths on the glass, more moisture
condensed and again the pencils were in
myriads. I enjoyed the small but brilliant
view in the same spirit in which I
enjoy the starry heavens on a grand
mountain outlook.</p>
<p>As I looked I thought of many things.
I thought of my own mind with its wondrous
thinking machinery; I thought of
my eyes and of their marvelous mechanism
by which the brain received so much
thought-producing material; I thought of
the burning furnace within my body that
sent out heated air laden with the invisible
vapor of water; I thought of the
laws of heat and cold by which that vapor
was instantly condensed and became visible
when it came in contact with the cold
glass; I thought of the transparent glass
and of all the changes it had passed
through since it was a mineral in the
primeval rocks; I thought of the tree with
its naked branches whose fibers were being
toughened by constant wrestling with
the wind; I thought of the leaves that in a
few weeks would cover those twigs and
conceal from me the electric light; I
thought of the invisible air with its
strange elements and properties, and of
the laws of meteorology that produced the
wind; I thought of the electric wire and
of the distant copper mines from which it
came; I thought of the mysterious force
that we call electricity, of the coal, the engine,
the machinery, that produce it, and
of the light that it produces; I thought of
the mysterious thing that we call light and
of the laws of light that gave me those
penciled rays; I thought of the things that
were made for &ldquo;glory and for beauty&rdquo; as
well as for practical utility; and I thought
of God.</p>
<p>And so, according to such knowledge as
I had of psychology, of physiology, of
physics, of meteorology, of botany, of
mineralogy, of chemistry, of optics, of
electricity, of esthetics, and of natural
theology, were my thoughts manifold,
rich, suggestive, correlated, inspiring,
spiritual even, in their last analysis.</p>
<p>That which to many would be a thing
of no interest, a commonplace sight not
worth a second glance, was to me full of
beauty, tinged with glory, spiritually helpful,
and an occasion for praising and worshiping
God.</p>

<h2 id="c14">THE BLACK-THROATED GREEN WARBLER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Dendroica virens.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>One of the interesting nature studies
is an investigation of the groups of insect-eating
birds in reference to their food
and the methods employed in obtaining
it. Some insects are useful to man, but
by far the larger number are a detriment
to his interests in one way or another.</p>
<p>The swallows and swifts are almost
constantly on the wing, dexterously
catching any insects that come in their
way. They are day birds and at night
are replaced by the nighthawks that feed
upon the night flying insects. Next are
the flycatchers that dart &ldquo;from ambush
at passing prey, and with a suggestive
click of the bill, return to their post.&rdquo;
The beautiful little hummingbird, ever
active on the wing, quickly sees and picks
from leaf or flower insects that would escape
the attention of other birds. The
woodpeckers and allied birds examine the
tree trunks and carefully listen for the
insect that may be boring through the
wood within. The vireos, like the good
housekeeper, examine the &ldquo;nooks and
corners to see that no skulker escapes.&rdquo;
The robin and its sister thrushes and the
numerous sparrows attend to the surface
of the earth, and aquatic birds extensively
destroy those insects whose development
takes place either in or on the water.</p>
<p>Not the least among the birds that
assist man in his warfare upon insect
pests are our beautiful and active warblers
that frequent the foliage of tree and
shrubs patiently gathering their insect
food.</p>
<p>One of these is the Black-throated
Green Warbler of our illustration. If we
desire to examine its habits, except during
the period of migration, we must
visit the forests of cone bearing trees in
the northern woods of the eastern United
States, in the Allegheny mountains and
from these points northward to Hudson
Bay. It is almost useless to seek this
bird in other places. Here, high up in
the cedars, pines and hemlock in cozy retreats
far out on the branches it builds its
nest. &ldquo;The foundation of the structure is
of fine shreds of bark, fine dry twigs of
the hemlock, bits of fine grass, weeds and
dried rootlets, intermixed with moss and
lined with rootlets, fine grass, some
feathers and horse hair.&rdquo; The nests are
usually bulky and loosely constructed.
These rollicksome Warblers have a peculiar
song which is very characteristic and
not easily forgotten. The descriptions of
this song are almost as numerous as are
the observers. One has given this rendering:
&ldquo;Hear me Saint Ther-e-sa.&rdquo; Another
has very aptly described it as sounding
like, &ldquo;Wee-wee-su-see,&rdquo; the syllables
&ldquo;uttered slowly and well drawn out; that
before the last in a lower tone than the
two former, and the last syllable noticeably
on the upward slide; the whole being
a sort of insect tone, altogether peculiar,
and by no means unpleasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The song of the Black-throated Green
Warbler is so unlike that of the other
warblers that it becomes an important
characteristic of the species. Mr. Chapman
says, &ldquo;There is a quality about it
like the droning of bees; it seems to voice
the restfulness of a midsummer day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who wish to observe this bird
and cannot go to its nesting retreats, in
the evergreen forests, must seek in any
wooded land during its migrations to and
from the tropics, where it finds an abundance
of food during the rigors of our
northern winters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c15">A LIBEL ON THE BIRDS.</h2>
<p>A few days ago I was watching the
curious actions of a sparrow on the sidewalk
in a rather quiet part of town. On
either side of the street were lofty brick
and stone buildings, with the usual multiplicity
of little niches and cavities in
and about the projecting cornices and
ornamental architecture. These sheltered
and inviting ledges had been utilized
from year to year by divers smaller tribes
of the feathered folk as nest-building
sites, and the little bird which had attracted
my attention had already laid the
foundation timbers of its prospective
house in a cosy niche of the cornice almost
directly over my head where I was
standing.</p>
<p>It was plainly evident that the sprightly
creature was seeking sticks of proper
length and strength to barricade a broad
hiatus in the front part of the cavity it
had chosen for its future home.</p>
<p>This opening was angular in form with
the vertex at the bottom and its sides separating
outwards towards the top, where
there was a span of perhaps four or five
inches.</p>
<p>As I stood with my elbow resting
against the low paling the confiding sparrow
hopped to within a yard or two of
my feet in searching for tiny twigs that
had fallen from the overhanging shrubbery.</p>
<p>It picked up a great many pieces and as
quickly dropped them. Then it would
stand perfectly still for a few minutes intently
scanning the limited landscape as
if in a brown study as to what move it
should next make.</p>
<p>Finally it set vigorously to work picking
up bits of material from an inch or two
to six inches in length. Instead of
flying away with a load it dropped them
in a little heap nearly if not quite parallel
to each other. Then poking its beak
into the pile and throwing the sticks
hither and thither it settled down to practical
business by seizing a stick of
medium length and flying away with its
burden dangling in the air. Of course,
I watched the little architect and saw her
mount straight up to the chosen ledge
and deposit the twig exactly crosswise
of the gaping notch. This operation she
repeated several times, always throwing
the sticks about as if intent upon selecting
a piece of special dimensions. No
human carpenter with measuring rule in
his hand could have been more expert.</p>
<p>In a moment the truth flashed into my
mind and I realized that I was verily the
human pupil of a little bird made famous
by honored mention in Holy Writ.</p>
<p>Why, the cunning worker had foreseen
to the ridicule of my own confessed
stupidity that in order to effectually bar
the exposed side of the chamber it must
of necessity select girders of successively
increasing length and size. Thus, as I
fancied it reasoned, a short stick would
not span the top of the dangerous gap;
while, on the other hand, a long stick
could not be used at the bottom because
it would strike smack against the side
walls before it could be placed in position
low enough. So all this clearly explained
why the bird should exercise such studied
care in selecting the large &ldquo;timbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days afterwards I visited the
scene of operations again, and by using
an opera glass found that the nest was
very nearly if not quite finished. The
menacing gap in the ledge no longer existed;
for there was a solid bulkhead in
its stead composed of longitudinal sticks
tied and stiffened by interwoven bits of
dry grass and such shreds of various
waste material as only bird intelligence
knows where to find.</p>
<p>More interested now than ever, I took
pains to climb into the attic of the three
story building where from a narrow
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
gable window I could look obliquely
down into the pretty nest now neatly
lined with tiny feathers and thistle down.
So much, then, for the sparrows and their
house building. I say sparrows now, for
during my later observations I had seen
both Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow diligently
working together.</p>
<p>But to advert now to our alleged &ldquo;libel&rdquo;
on the birds, I have only to say that
it is very convenient for great men and
ponderous books to tell us that the lower
animals perform their actions by means
of a tendency called &ldquo;instinct;&rdquo; and thus
divest themselves of all further responsibility
in the matter. Confronted by this
obscure declaration we are led as pupils
in natural history to ask, &ldquo;What is instinct?&rdquo;
The following definitions of this
much-abused term are, perhaps, the best
to be found in the English language:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct is a propensity prior to experience
and independent of instruction.&rdquo;&mdash;William
Paley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct is a blind tendency to some
mode of action, independent of any consideration
on the part of the agent, of the
end to which the action leads.&rdquo;&mdash;Richard
Whately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinct is an agent which performs
blindly and ignorantly a work of intelligence
and knowledge.&rdquo;&mdash;Sir William
Hamilton.</p>
<p>Now such names as Paley, Whately
and Hamilton stand high upon the roll of
honor in the sparkling literature of our
language; and yet the words of these
great scholars are but as sounding brass
and a tinkling cymbal when they undertake
to tell us what is the real import and
inwardness of that occult and wonderful
faculty in the mental essence of animals
which scientists by force of circumstances
have agreed to call &ldquo;instinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; my little sparrow would say,
could she speak our language, &ldquo;we perform
our actions neither blindly nor ignorantly,
as your famous Mr. Hamilton
learnedly remarks; but God has taught
us to both reason and work according to
existing circumstances, from cause to effect;
nay, even as your great logicians
would have it, a priori. And although
five of our little bodies were sold in the
markets of Jerusalem for two farthings,
not one of us ever fell to the ground
without our Father&rsquo;s notice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There, that is about the kind of sermon
our little bird would preach to the
utter discomfiture of human wisdom,
which, after all, is but &ldquo;foolishness with
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verily, and in conclusion, we declare
that it is a libel upon the birds to say
that they build their nests guided only by
that nameless tendency signified by the
common acceptation of the term &ldquo;instinct.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c16">BERYL.</h2>
<p>This mineral species includes a number
of varieties which are highly valued as
gems. These are, besides Beryl itself, the
gems emerald, aquamarine and golden
beryl. Chrysoberyl, it may be noted, is
not a variety of Beryl, but a distinct species.</p>
<p>While these gems all differ in color,
they are the same mineral and are practically
identical in composition, hardness
and other properties. In composition
they are a silicate of aluminum and glucinum,
the percentage being, for normal
beryl, 67 per cent of silica, 19 per cent of
alumina and 14 per cent of glucina.</p>
<p>The beautiful green color of the emerald
is probably due to a small quantity of
chromium which it usually contains,
though some authorities believe organic
matter to be the coloring ingredient. To
what substance the other varieties of the
species owe their color is not known.</p>
<p>In hardness the varieties of Beryl differ
little from quartz, the hardness being 7.5
to 8 in the scale of which quartz is 7.
They are somewhat inferior therefore to
such gems as topaz, sapphire and ruby in
wearing qualities, although hard enough
for ordinary purposes.</p>
<p>The specific gravity of Beryl is also
about like that of quartz, ranging from
2.63 to 2.80; the specific gravity of quartz
being 2.65. The varieties of Beryl are
therefore relatively light as compared
with other gems.</p>
<p>Beryl crystallizes in the hexagonal system.
It usually occurs as six-sided
prisms, commonly terminated by a single
flat plane, but sometimes by numerous
small planes giving a rounded effect and
occasionally by pyramidal planes which
cause the prism to taper to a sharp point.</p>
<p>The crystals sometimes grow to enormous
size, exceeding those of any other
known mineral. Thus, one found in
Grafton, New Hampshire, was four and
one-quarter feet in length and weighed
two thousand nine hundred pounds. Another
in the same locality is estimated
to weigh two and one-half tons.
In the museum of the Boston Society
of Natural History and in the
United States National Museum are exhibited
single crystals also of great size.
That in Boston is three and one-half feet
long by three feet wide and weighs several
tons. That in the National Museum
weighs over six hundred pounds.</p>
<p>None of these crystals are of a high
degree of purity or transparency, but the
crystal planes at least of the prisms are
well developed.</p>
<p>Beryl crystals have no marked cleavage
except a slight one parallel with the
base. Where broken, the surface shows
what is called conchoidal fracture, i. e. it
exhibits little rounded concavities and
convexities resembling a shell in shape.</p>
<p>The mineral is quite brittle. Some
emeralds even have the annoying habit of
breaking of their own accord soon after
removal from the mine. This can be
prevented by warming them gradually
before exposing them to the heat of the
sun or other sudden heat.</p>
<p>Beryl and its varieties, like tourmaline,
are dichroic, i. e. the stones exhibit different
colors when viewed in different directions.
This dichroism can sometimes be
observed by the naked eye, but often not
without the aid of the instrument known
as the dichroscope. When seen it furnishes
a positive means of distinguishing
a true stone from any glass imitations.</p>
<p>The varieties of Beryl have none of
the brilliancy of the diamond and therefore
depend wholly on their body colors
and their lustre for their beauty and attractiveness.
Fortunately they exhibit
these qualities as well by artificial light as
by daylight.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Ordinary Beryl is a mineral of comparatively common occurrence, being
often found in granitic and metamorphic
rocks.</p>
<p>That of common occurrence is usually
too clouded and fractured to be of use
for gem cutting. There are many localities,
however, where Beryls of gem
quality occur.</p>
<p>The finest emeralds in the world come
from Muso, a locality in the United
States of Colombia, seventy-five miles N.
N. W. of Bogota. It is a wild and inaccessible
region and the mining of the
gems is a precarious occupation. The
emeralds occur according to Bauer in a
dark, bituminous limestone which is
shown by fossils to be of Cretaceous age.
As emeralds in other localities occur only
in eruptive or metamorphic rocks, it
seems probable that the Muso emeralds
have washed in from an older formation.
The emerald bearing beds are horizontal,
overlying red sandstone and clay slate.
Calcite, quartz, pyrite and the rare mineral
parisite are other minerals found associated
with the emerald. The manner
of working these emerald mines is thus
described by Streeter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mine is now worked by a company,
who pay an annual rent for it to the
government, and employ one hundred and
twenty workmen. It has the form of a
tunnel of about one hundred yards deep,
with very inclined walls. On the summit
of the mountains, and quite near to the
mouth of the mine, are large lakes,
whose waters are shut off by means of
water-gates, which can be easily shifted
when the laborers require water. When
the waters are freed they rush with great
rapidity down the walls of the mine, and
on reaching the bottom of it they are conducted
by means of an underground canal
through the mountain into a basin. To
obtain the emeralds the workmen begin
by cutting steps on the inclined walls of
the mine, in order to make firm resting
places for their feet. The overseer places
the men at certain distances from each
other to cut out wide steps with the help
of pickaxes. The loosened stones fall by
their own weight to the bottom of the
mine. When this begins to fill, a sign is
given to let the waters loose, which rush
down with great vehemence, carrying the
fragments of rock with them through the
mountain into the basin. This operation
is repeated until the horizontal beds are
exposed in which the emeralds are
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next most prominent locality
whence gem emeralds are obtained is that
in Siberia on the river Tokovoya, forty-five
miles east of Ekaterinburg. The emeralds
here found are often larger than
any yet obtained in South America, but
they are not of so good quality. They occur
in mica schist (see colored plate),
and often associated with the mineral
phenacite, chrysoberyl, rutile, etc.</p>
<p>Other localities whence emeralds are
obtained are Upper Egypt (the source of
those known to the ancients), the Heubachthal
in Austria, and Alexander county,
North Carolina, in our own country.
The latter locality is no longer worked,
but it has afforded a number of fine crystals.</p>
<p>Aquamarines and transparent Beryls
are found in Siberia, India, Brazil, and
in many localities in the United States.
Dana describes an aquamarine from Brazil
which approaches in size, and also in
form, the head of a calf. It weighs two
hundred and twenty-five ounces troy, is
transparent and without a flaw. In the
Field Columbian Museum is to be seen a
beautiful cut aquamarine from Siberia
more than two inches in diameter and
weighing three hundred and thirty-one
carats. Here is also the finest specimen
of blue Beryl ever cut in the United
States. It was found in Stoneham, Me.,
is rich sea green color in one direction
and sea blue in another. It weighs one
hundred and thirty-three carats. Numerous
other Maine localities have furnished
gem Beryls. Golden Beryls are found in
Maine, Connecticut, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania and other United States localities,
as well as in Siberia and Ceylon.
From them are obtained gems of rich
golden color resembling topaz.</p>
<p>Beryl of a pale rose color is sometimes
found, and when of good quality is cut
for gem purposes, but it is of too rare
occurrence to be important.</p>
<p>Emeralds seem to have been known and
prized from the earliest times. They are
mentioned in the Bible in several places,
the earliest mention being in Exodus,
where they are described as one of the
stones making up the ephod of the high
priest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Their use in Egypt dates back to an
unrecorded past and they frequently appear
in the ornaments found upon mummies.
Readers of Roman history will remember
that the Emperor Nero used an
emerald constantly as an eye glass.</p>
<p>The Incas, Aztecs and other highly civilized
peoples of South America were
found using these gems profusely for
purposes of adornment and for votive offerings
when first visited by the Spaniards.
It was partly the desire to secure
these gems which led Cortez and his followers,
early in the sixteenth century, to
undertake the conquest of Peru. Some
of the emeralds wrested from the Incas
by Cortez and brought to Spain are said
to have been marvels of the lapidary&rsquo;s
art. One was carved into the form of a
rose, another that of a fish with golden
eyes, and another that of a bell with a
pearl for a clapper.</p>
<p>During the years following Cortez&rsquo; conquest
large quantities of emeralds were
brought to Europe, and they became
much more popular and widely distributed
than previously. Joseph D&rsquo;Acosta, a
traveler of the period, says the ship in
which he returned from America to Spain
carried two chests, each of which contained
one hundred pounds&rsquo; weight of
fine emeralds.</p>
<p>From what locality the Peruvians
themselves obtained these gems is not
known, unless it was the Colombian locality
at Muso, already described. The
Spaniards were led to these mines in
1558. They continued the working of
them, and there has been practically no
interruption in their operation since that
time.</p>
<p>The ancients had many superstitions
regarding the emerald, one being that it
had a power to cure diseases of the eye.
Another was that it would reveal the inconstancy
of lovers by changing color.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;It is a gem that hath the power to show</p>
<p class="t0">If plighted lovers keep their troth or no.</p>
<p class="t0">If faithful, it is like the leaves of Spring;</p>
<p class="t0">If faithless, like those leaves when withering.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>So writes one poet.</p>
<p>Again, they believed the emerald would
blind the eyes of the serpent:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Blinded like serpents when they gaze</p>
<p class="t0">Upon the emerald&rsquo;s virgin blaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;Moore.</p>
</div>
<p>Of these traditions, perhaps the only
one held in any esteem at the present
time is that which associates the emerald
with the month of June, making it the
talismanic gem or &ldquo;birth stone&rdquo; of persons
born in that month.</p>
<p>The largest and most beautiful emerald
known to be in existence at the present
time is one owned by the Duke of
Devonshire. This is an uncut six-sided
crystal about two inches long and of the
same diameter. It is of perfect color, almost
flawless and quite transparent.</p>
<p>Like all other gems, the value of emeralds
varies much according to their perfection.
Those of the best grade are
worth at least one hundred dollars a carat.
The color should be a dark velvety green,
those of lighter shades being much less
valuable. Owing to the extreme brittleness
of the mineral, emeralds usually contain
flaws, so that &ldquo;an emerald without a
flaw&rdquo; has passed into a proverb to indicate
a thing almost unattainable.</p>
<p>Aquamarine and other varieties of
Beryl seem not to have been as highly
esteemed as emerald by the ancients, although
Beryl is mentioned in the Bible,
and early writers describe gems evidently
belonging to the species. They were
probably less well known to the ancients,
as nearly all the localities from which
aquamarines and Beryls are now obtained
are of comparatively modern discovery.
They are gems in every way as worthy
as the emerald, however, and will doubtless
become more popular as their qualities
are better known.</p>

<h2 id="c17">SONG BIRDS OF THE SOUTHWEST.</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A pleasing land of drowsy-head it was,</p>
<p class="t0">Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;New birds, new flowers, new pleasures,&rdquo;
I murmur as my vision widens
upon the, to me, new world of Arizona.
A new delight indeed, notwithstanding
the often impressed fact that the old footpath-ways
of Ohio are, after many years,
still but half discovered countries. But
&rsquo;tis human, this desire for novelty, and I
am not at all in advance of my fellow kindred
in arriving at that stage of blessed
content which we see expressed upon
every side of us in the lives of the lesser
(?) creatures who abide without unrest
until compelled by the necessities of necessity
to &ldquo;move on.&rdquo; But I echo Richard
Jefferies: &ldquo;a fresh flower, a fresh path-way,
a fresh delight,&rdquo; and am so far content;
and, truly, coming from the east of
living greens, &rsquo;tis a new kingdom of somber
mountains and sandy desert at which I
have arrived. To an imaginative person
it is a land filled with the echoes of a distant
past, even now but half heard and in
my mind the golden glow of a day that is
dead enfolds the silent hills, a silence of
grandeur, not of nature which is here
alive and keen to the fullest extent. With
many other naturalists, I agree that if one
desires to learn the secrets of the field and
forest, one must go about singly and
alone. There is something strange about
it too, while one person alone is allowed
to see many of the inner movements of
wild life, when two or three are gathered
together, they seem to intimidate the
wood folk to an unlimited extent.</p>
<p>But bird life in this far away territory,
notwithstanding Dr. Charles Abbott&rsquo;s experience
to the contrary, seems to me to
be much more companionable and less
timid than in the more thickly populated
east, and also, bird curiosity is more noticeable
than in those states where generations
of experience has obviated all desire
for any close scrutiny or investigation of
that queer biped without feathers. One
has only to sit silent and quiet for a few
moments to have his ornithological interest
aroused by numerous visitors, who,
with impatient &ldquo;chips&rdquo; and &ldquo;twits&rdquo; question
his presence among them. While
Gila county makes up her quota of song
birds in quantity, she lacks something in
decorative quality, at least so far as coloring
of plumage is concerned. There is
no question but what the very arid atmosphere
of this section is not without
its marked effect upon feather coloring,
and on account of this dullness of plumage,
I was at first unable to classify
numbers of birds who were perfectly familiar
to me in Ohio. Birds like the blue
jay lose much of the metallic gorgeousness
of their plumage and are under a
veil as it were, showing a dull, bluish
gray. The blackbirds also are decidedly
rusty in appearance, hardly holding their
own with the great glossy ravens (Corvus
principalis) who have so adapted
themselves to civilization as to have become
almost a necessity as purveyors of
edible refuse and debris which accumulates
in such abundance about the abodes
of mankind, who are supposedly the
most hygienic and cleanly of all creatures,
but whose abiding places &lsquo;au natural&rsquo;
present an unsightly spectacle in comparison
with the nests of birds, but of course
it is because our requirements are so
much greater, and education has developed
a love of &ldquo;accumulations&rdquo; among
us, herein must lie all blame. But we
&ldquo;progress&rdquo; or so we have determined.</p>
<p>However, I never see these dignified
crows of stately motion moving about
without remembering Virgil&rsquo;s:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The crow with clamorous cries the shower demands,</p>
<p class="t0">And single stalks along the desert sands.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>But in Arizona his demand for showers
is vain, for the absence of the &ldquo;rain
maker&rdquo; is her greatest deficit.</p>
<p>To return to the atmospheric or arid
effect upon color, I fail to understand
why the bleaching process is so observable
in feathers, yet the most brilliant
and tropical coloring predominates in the
flora. Does the plant world absorb all of
the richest coloring matter of the sunlight,
or do they possess an antidote to
the alkaline properties of the air? Is atmospheric
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
moisture that is not obtainable
necessary in feather coloring? Some of
the plants here are sufficient unto themselves,
brewing their own sustenance as
it were, as I have seen the Bisnaga,
sometimes called &ldquo;Well of the Desert&rdquo; in
which a deep hole had been cut, produce
in a short time at least a cup full of watery
liquid, which is very invigorating to
the thirsty traveler, and growing, too, in
a sand as dry as powder, there not having
been a drop of rain near it in months, if
not years, and dew an unknown quantity.
This liquor seems necessary for the full
fruition of the rich, yellow flower, so
carefully guarded by immense fish-hook
spines or barbs that is such efficient protection
to this species of cacti. As effectual
is this protection as is the venomous
reputation of that much maligned
saurian, the Gila monster (Heloderma
suspectum), which is not one-half so bad
as his looks would imply, but he is formidable
in appearance when he puffs
forth his breath like a miniature steam
engine and at the same time emits a
greenish saliva from his mouth, which is
to say the least a forbidding performance,
but I really believe him to be comparatively
harmless, for after considerable
acquaintance with his habits, I have
only learned of one person being bitten
by this reptile, and that was a man who
was drunk and insisted upon tickling
the Gila monster on the mouth and was
bitten for his pains. The reptile had to
be killed before its teeth could be unlocked.
As an antidote an attempt was
made to fill the man with whisky, but as
he was already full but little could be
accomplished in that line; when he got
sober he was all right save that his hand
was somewhat paralyzed.</p>
<p>There is a marked gregariousness
among the song birds of Arizona or else
the present abundance of all species gives
one that impression, for the numbers are
almost countless, though human depredators
are fast depopulating the songsters
for the sake of their own pleasure
or bird plumage for profit. While women
anathematize men for their inordinate desire
to kill something, they take an equivocal
stand as critics, yet wearing a hat
adorned with one or more dead bodies of
birds. It is truly the old question of
mote and beam re-enacted.</p>
<p>I do not remember of meeting with but
one bird which I have been entirely unable
to classify or even learn its common
name if it has one. It darts in and out
of a thorn bush after the manner of a
thresher or cat bird, and about equals
them in size; is of a dull canary yellow
in color save for a rich red cap slightly
tufted and worn jauntily on top of his
head. I have never heard any note from
him save a startled chip, and have been
unable to learn anything about him from
the various bird histories.</p>
<p>Dr. Abbott has remarked on the lack
of vocal powers among the birds of Arizona,
and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I listened hour after hour to these
cheerful birds, fancying there was melody
in their attempts at song, and wondering
why, when their lines had been
cast in such forbidding places, the gift of
sweet song had not been vouchsafed
them. Does the extremely dry atmosphere
have to do with it? Not a sound
that I heard had that fulness of tone
common to the allied utterances at home.
At the limit of my longest stroll I heard
a mountain mocking bird, as it is misnamed
in the books, and his was a disappointed
song. It was the twanging of
a harp of a single string, and that a loose
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This absence of note richness is a
feature that I have not observed, and
never have I heard a more musical chorus
from bird throats as one after another of
the many sorts and conditions awoke at
sunrise. Many a time have I listened
while camping on a lone mountaintop,
where our only canopy was the pine-fretted
blue heavens, and heard the rich
burst of song in which not a note lacked
flavor; mocking birds, thrushes, orioles,
wrens, finches, vireos, grosbeaks, robins
(and their distinguishable note is likely
to make one homesick) thrashers, blue
birds, tanagers, etc., all filling in the
score, as each was awakened and filled in
the line of song, to say nothing of whip-poor-wills,
owls and other night singers
who have had &ldquo;their day.&rdquo; I feel sure if
Dr. Abbott had given a little more time
to the study of bird song in this territory
he would have had no cause to complain
of or discredit the vocal powers of these
western songsters.</p>

<p class="caption">AFRICAN LION.
<br />(Felis leo).</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c18">THE AFRICAN LION.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Felis leo.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The African Lion, familiar to the general
public as the sulky tenant of a barred
cage, ranges with freer strides throughout
the length and breadth of Africa, and
even extends through Persia into the
northwestern part of India. Fossil remains
show that at one time Felis
leo inhabited the southern part of
Europe as well, but the king of
beasts was evidently considered good
sport by primitive man, and he became
extinct in Europe except where, in the
Roman amphitheatres, and in many a
meaner cage since, he has roared for the
edification of the populace.</p>
<p>The literature of all nations is full of
allusions to the Lion; to his bravery, his
grandeur and his strength. The old Assyrian
kings carved pictures of themselves
in bas relief hurling javelins into
crouching Lions, and many a sportsman
is to-day beating the thorn-thickets and
trailing over the sandy plains of Africa
with the same unreasoning enthusiasm,
yet hoping, perhaps, in a vague way to
hand down his name along with the Assyrian
kings by writing a book. It is the
Lion&rsquo;s misfortune as well as his glory
that he is king of beasts.</p>
<p>The Lion differs from the other Felid&aelig;
in the great strength and massive proportions
of his head and shoulders, and more
especially in the arrangement and growth
of the hair on the body. Where, in other
cats, the hair lies flat and close along the
skin, the Lion is so clothed only on his
yellowish-brown body. The hair of the
top of the head and of the neck to the
shoulders stands erect or bristles forward,
forming the beautiful and characteristic
mane of the adult male and suggesting in
a way not otherwise possible the massive
strength of the great paws, one blow from
which will fell an ox or crush the skull
of a man without an effort. In most
Lions the mane is of a darker color than
the remainder of the body, being often almost
black. The elbows, tip of tail and
the under parts of the body are also
clothed with this long, bristly hair, but
it is found only on males above three
years of age. The females have smaller
heads and shoulders and are of a uniform
color.</p>
<p>In many minor ways the Lion is specially
adapted for his predatory life. Every
tooth in his head is sharp pointed or
sharp edged. The great canine teeth are
set far apart in his square jaws and locked
together like a vice. The molars are
transformed from grinders into incisors,
yet are so strong that they will crack
heavy bones. The papill&aelig; on the tongue
are so developed that they resemble long,
horny spines curved backwards, giving
the tongue the appearance of a coarse
rasp. With this rough tongue the Lion
can lick the meat from bones as easily as
a house cat eats butter, and should a
friendly Lion lick his keeper&rsquo;s hand the
flesh would be torn and the blood flow.
The claws are very large and sharp, and
are so nicely sheathed in the soft cushions
of his feet that the Lion neither blunts
nor wears them down. Yet when he
strikes with tense paws every claw is like
a hook and a dagger to tear and cut.</p>
<p>In seeking his prey the Lion lies in
wait by springs and water holes and
leaps upon his victims from the ambush
of some bush or rock as yellow as his own
tawny hide; or, failing in this, he sneaks
up the wind and through the thickets and
reeds of a watercourse or swamp and
quickly leaps upon a surprised antelope or
zebra or savage buffalo, crushing it to
the ground by his great weight, while he
strikes and tears it with paws and teeth.
In cultivated districts the Lion prowls
about the fields and villages, seizing cattle
and sheep, and often, when he is old
and lazy, rushes into some camp or hut
at night and carries off a man. In many
parts of Africa the natives build great
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
corrals of thorns about their camps to
keep the Lions away, and should one be
heard in the night they light fires and
wave torches until the dawn.</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances the Lion
attends to his own hunting, and when
seen in the daytime retreats to some
denser cover where he will not be disturbed.
This is often cited as an evidence
of cowardice, but is such a common characteristic
of big game and of animals,
and even men of undoubted courage, that
it should not be held against him. There
is no animal in the world which can consistently
hunt for trouble and survive,
and so long as the Lion can keep his
stomach filled and his sleep undisturbed
he is probably content to waive the title
of king of beasts.</p>
<p>Lion hunting has been held a royal
sport in all times, with the result that
the Lion has been exterminated in many
parts of its natural habitat and forced
back into the wilder parts of desert and
plain. Unlike the tiger, the Lion is rarely
found in forests, and is unable to climb
trees. He is ordinarily stalked in the daytime,
when, with stomach full, he sleeps
among rocks and bushes, or shot from
stands as he approaches some water hole
or carcass by night. The literature of
African exploration and travel abounds
with accounts of Lions killed by men and
men killed by Lions. In these days of
zinc balls and repeating rifles it is generally
the Lion that is killed. To the
thorough-paced English sportsman like
Sir Samuel Baker or Gordon Cumming
the Lion hunt is recreation merely, and
with their ten-bore rifles and British
phlegm they are in no more danger than
if they were chasing foxes through the
dales of England.</p>
<p>The family life of the Lion is very interesting
and human. So far as is known,
a single male and female remain together
year after year, irrespective of the pairing
season, the Lion feeding and caring
for his Lioness and cubs and educating the
young in the duties of life. For two or
three years the cubs follow their parents,
so that Lions are often found in small
troops. Cases have been reported where
they have joined for a preconcerted hunt,
and the Lioness often goes up the wind to
startle game and drive it towards her ambushed
mate, following after for a share
of the prey. Hon. W. H. Drummond, in
&ldquo;The Large Game and Natural History
of South and Southeast Africa,&rdquo; gives the
following account of the feast after the
victim had been slain: &ldquo;The Lion had
by this time quite killed the beautiful
animal, but instead of proceeding to eat
it, he got up and roared vigorously until
there was an answer, and in a few minutes
a Lioness, accompanied by four
whelps, came trotting up from the same
direction as the zebra, which no doubt
she had been to drive towards her husband.
They formed a fine picture as they
all stood round the carcass, the whelps
tearing it and biting it, but unable to get
through the tough skin. Then the Lion
lay down, and the Lioness, driving her
offspring before her, did the same, four
or five yards off, upon which he got up
and, commencing to eat, had soon finished
a hind leg, retiring a few yards on
one side as soon as he had done so. The
Lioness came up next and tore the carcass
to shreds, bolting huge mouthfuls,
but not objecting to the whelps eating as
much as they could find. There was a
good deal of snarling and quarreling
among these young Lions, and occasionally
a standup fight for a minute, but their
mother did not take any notice of them
except to give them a smart blow with
her paw if they got in her way. There
was now little left of the zebra but a
few bones, and the whole Lion family
walked quietly away, the Lioness leading,
and the Lion often turning his head to see
that they were not followed, bringing up
the rear.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c20">THE ALASKAN MOOSE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Alces gigas.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Alaska Moose is the largest of the
deer family in America. Alces gigas is
a comparatively new species, having been
described in 1899. At present it is still
quite numerous along the Yukon and its
tributaries, though the influx of prospectors
and the settling of the Klondike region
has already resulted in a marked
falling off in Moose and an increase of
Moose meat. In the winter this is the staple
diet of both Indians and whites, and
on account of the high price paid&mdash;one
dollar or two dollars per pound&mdash;many
prospectors have found Moose hunting
even more remunerative than mining.</p>
<p>Alces gigas was first collected by Mr.
Dall De Weese, of Canon City, Colo., who
spent three months, in 1898, on the Kenai
Peninsula, Alaska, in quest of large mammals
for the United States Museum.
From the six specimens of the Alaskan
Moose which he collected it is seen that
this animal differs considerably from the
Moose (Alces americanus) inhabiting
the east United States and eastern and
central Canada, being larger and more
richly colored and having a much heavier
mandible. Its general color is a grizzle
of black and wood brown, darkening
along the spine and changing abruptly to
clear black on chest, buttocks and lower
part of sides.</p>
<p>The horns of the Moose are very characteristic,
being of immense size and palmated
before and behind so that an average
full-grown pair weighs seventy
pounds and shows a spread of forty-six
inches between the points of the posterior
branch as against a length of thirty-eight
inches. Our illustration is a photograph
of one with horns of remarkable size,
measuring about seventy-one inches from
tip to tip in a line across the head. It
is not until the third year that the horns
are palmated, and they increase in size
from year to year. In the winter the old
horns are cast, but they sprout again in
the spring, and by June have shed their
velvet and appear a beautiful white. Although
so large and characteristic, it is
not known that they serve any more useful
purpose than as weapons during the
rutting season. In running through the
woods the Moose throws his head back,
and, despite the spread and weight of
his horns, he is able to move about without
breaking a twig.</p>
<p>The clumsy shape of the head is accentuated
by the hump on the nose, which is
due to the excessive development of the
nasal septum and of the upper lip, which
is long and supple, and adapted to browsing
rather than to cropping grass. The
short neck of the Moose would in any
case interfere with the cropping of grass,
even if it were found in the snowy inlands
of Alaska. Its common food is the
twigs and bark of willows and birches,
which it rides down to reach the tops,
lichens and mosses and the aquatic plants
of summer.</p>
<p>In winter the Moose herd together
in the snow, forming great tramped-down
places called moose yards by hunters. In
summer comes the rutting season, in
which the great males shake their antlers
and attack any animal that comes their
way. With summer comes mosquitoes
also, and these pester the Moose to such
an extent that they are galled to a greater
fury. So it is that the Moose is a most
dangerous animal in the time when the
ground is clear, the swamps full of mosquitoes
and his horns new-stripped of velvet
for the fray.</p>
<p>When the snow lies so deep that he
cannot travel even with his long legs, the
enemies of the Moose have him at a disadvantage,
and often the yards are attacked
by wolves or bears or, worse yet,
by agile men on snowshoes. Killing in
the snow is not recognized as legitimate
sport, and is resorted to only by skin
hunters or men lacking in the higher
ideals of sportsmen. The ordinary method
of hunting deer in the summer is by
imitating the rutting cry of the male, the
reply of the cow and the defiant challenge
of the male again, followed by the thrashing
and scraping of the trees and branches
where the hunter lies concealed. These
cries are produced by blowing through a
birchbark horn, and on account of the
blind fury of the rutting males they are
often very successful in bringing them to
their death.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/i1036.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="663" />
<p class="caption">ALASKAN MOOSE.
<br />(Alces gigas).</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>The Indians and half-breeds of the far
North stalk the wary Moose where he
beds himself down after a night of browsing,
but so acute is his hearing and sense
of smell and so great his cunning that
only the trained woodsman can hope for
success. Leaving his feed-trail abruptly,
the Moose moves off to one side down the
wind so that any one trailing him will
be surely scented, and there beds himself
down for the day. The Indian follows
the well-defined trail of the Moose until it
becomes fresh, and then by a series of
circuits down the wind and leading back
to the trail, like the semicircles of the
letter B, he gradually approaches the
hiding place until at last, coming up the
wind, he sights his prey and, startling it
by a slight sound, shoots it where it
stands.</p>
<p>The young are brought forth in the
early summer and stay with their mother
until the third year. During this time
she defends them with the greatest ferocity
from man and wild animals alike,
using her sharp hoofs in striking out at
wolves and men, often trampling them
into the snow in her fury. The new-born
young are very helpless at first on their
long, tottering legs, and, roaming as they
do in a wild land of wolves and beasts of
prey, they could scarcely survive at all
without the protection of their mother&rsquo;s
knife-like hoofs. So long and awkward
are the legs of Moose that in running
through the woods the hind feet often
interfere with the fore feet, throwing the
clumsy animal in a heap. The falling of
Moose while running was considered so
unaccountable at first that it was assigned
to attacks of epilepsy, but it has since been
discovered that when galloping the
Moose spreads his hind feet far apart in
a more or less successful effort to avoid
tripping up his fore feet. But when we
consider his load of horns and the fallen
trees and broken branches of his native
haunts it is a marvel that he is able to
outrun his foes at all, whereas the Moose
is in fact the swiftest animal in the Northern
woods.</p>

<h2 id="c22">THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A DUCK.
<br /><span class="small">FOUNDED UPON FACT.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;How queer, my child! what a long,
broad mouth you have, and what peculiar
feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was my mother, a big brown hen,
who spoke. I had stepped from my egg,
only a short while before, and as I was
the only one hatched out of the whole
thirteen, my poor mother was greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>Now, to add to her troubles, there
seemed to be something very peculiar
about my appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on still watching me
critically, &ldquo;I have raised many families,
but never a chick like you. Well! well!
don&rsquo;t cry about it. Your yellow dress is
very pretty. It doesn&rsquo;t pay to be too sensitive,
as you will find, I am afraid, when
you have lived with these chickens. Some
of them are dreadfully trying. Dear!
dear! how stiff I am! This setting is
tiresome work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what sort of home we are
going to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our home, into which we moved a few
hours later, proved to be an upturned
soap box. Seven little chickens were
there before us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same old story,&rdquo; said my mother
with a knowing air. &ldquo;People imagine we
hens have no sense. I did not hatch those
chickens, but I am expected to care for
them, as though I did. Some mothers
would peck them so they would be glad to
stay away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had too good a heart for this,
however, and I was very glad to have
these brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>They were different from me, though,
in many ways, principally, in their dislike
for water. They hated even to get their
feet wet, while I dearly loved to get in the
pond, and swim around on its surface, or
even dive down to the bottom, where such
nice fat worms lived.</p>
<p>My poor mother never could understand
my tastes. The first time she saw
me on the water, she came rushing towards
me, screaming and beating her
wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my child! my child!&rdquo; she cried,
with tears in her eyes. &ldquo;You will drown!
You will drown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I loved her, and so could not bear to see
her distress. It was hard to be different
from all the others.</p>
<p>I had a little yellow sister who was a
great comfort to me at these times. I
could never persuade her to try the
water,&mdash;but she always sat upon the edge
of the pond while I had my swim. We
shared everything with each other; even
our troubles.</p>
<p>About this time, my voice began to
change. It had been a soft little &ldquo;peep,&rdquo;
but now it grew so harsh, that some of
the old hens made unpleasant remarks
about it, and my mother was worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t talking. It&rsquo;s quacking,&rdquo; said an
old, brown-headed hen who was always
complaining of her nerves.</p>
<p>She was very cross and spent most of
her time standing on one leg in a corner
and pecking any poor chicken that came
in her reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know why it&rsquo;s quacking?&rdquo;
asked a stately Buff Cochin who was a
stranger in the yard; having arrived only
that morning. &ldquo;That child isn&rsquo;t a chicken.
She&rsquo;s a duck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you giving us?&rdquo; said a dandified
Cock, who was busy pluming his feathers.
&ldquo;Whoever heard of a duck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you, I daresay,&rdquo; answered the
Buff with a contemptuous sniff. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy
to see you have never been away from this
yard. I have traveled, I would have you
understand, and I know a duck, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care what you call her,&rdquo;
snapped the cross one. &ldquo;I only hope she&rsquo;ll
keep her voice out of my hearing. The
sound of it gives me nervous prostration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for poor me,&mdash;I stole quietly away,
and went up into a corner of the chicken
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
house to cry. I was a duck, alas! and
different from all about me. No wonder
I was lonely.</p>
<p>My mother asked the cause of my
trouble, and when I told her she looked
sad and puzzled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what a
duck is,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;things have been
strangely mixed. But cheer up. Whatever
comes you are still my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was indeed a comfort to me. For
never had chicken or duck a better
mother.</p>
<p>There was consolation also, in what the
kind old Buff Cochin told me.</p>
<p>I had nothing to be ashamed of, she
said, for ducks were much esteemed by
those who knew them.</p>
<p>From her this had more weight, for we
all regarded the Buff Cochin as very superior.
They were well born, and well
bred, and had seen life in many places.
Their husband, too, was a thorough gentleman.</p>
<p>However, he also was having his
troubles now. He was losing his old
feathers, and his new ones were long in
coming. Consequently, his appearance
was shabby, and he staid away from the
hens.</p>
<p>Poor fellow, he looked quite forlorn,
leaning up against a sunny corner of the
barn, trying to keep warm. I believe he
felt the loss of his tail feathers most for
the young roosters who strutted by in
their fine new coats, made sneering remarks
about it.</p>
<p>I was very sorry for him, but my own
troubles were getting to be as much as I
could bear; for just when I needed a sympathetic
mother she was taken from me
and her place filled by a big, bare-headed
hen as high tempered as she was homely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raising a duck,&rdquo; she said with a contemptuous
sniff at me. &ldquo;I never supposed
I&rsquo;d come to that. Well, I&rsquo;ll keep
you, but understand one thing, don&rsquo;t go
quacking around me, and don&rsquo;t bring
your wet and mud into the house. I&rsquo;m
not your other mother. My children don&rsquo;t
rule me. I won&rsquo;t have that Mrs. Redbreast
saying my house is dirty. There&rsquo;s
no standing that hen anyhow. I&rsquo;ll give
her my opinion if she puts on her airs
around me. There&rsquo;s too much mixture
here. One can&rsquo;t tell where breed begins
or ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not many days later, before my
mother and Mrs. Redbreast came to
words and then blows. The cause was
only a worm, but it was enough. Mrs.
Redbreast insisted that it was hers. My
mother thought otherwise, and with a
screech of defiance rushed upon her
enemy. Dust and feathers flew. We children
withdrew to a safe distance, and
with necks stretched watched in fear and
trembling.</p>
<p>The fight, though fierce, was short.
Our mother was victorious, but she had
lost the tail feathers of which she had
been so proud, and I am sure she never
forgave Mrs. Redbreast.</p>
<p>Like children, chickens and ducks grow
older and bigger with the passing days.</p>
<p>In time we were taken from our
mothers and put to roost with the older
hens and cocks. I was not made to roost
so I spent my nights alone in a corner of
the chicken house.</p>
<p>It was quieter down there&mdash;for up
above the chickens all fought for best
place, and their cackling and fluttering
was disturbing.</p>
<p>The old gentleman was very heavy.
Not only was it hard for him to fly up to
the roost, but equally hard for him to hold
on when once there. Yet I could never
persuade him to rest on the floor with me.
Like his kind, he preferred the discomfort
of sleeping on a pole&mdash;a taste I cannot understand.</p>
<p>I was four months old before I saw
one of my own kind. Then, one day
three ducks were brought into the yard.
They did not seem to mind being stared
at, but fell to eating corn and talking
among themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horribly greedy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Redbreast.
&ldquo;I for one don&rsquo;t care to associate
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you know what you look like, old
quacker,&rdquo; snapped the cross hen, with a
peck at me. &ldquo;My poor nerves will suffer
sadly now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These unkind remarks scarcely disturbed
me, however. There was a new
feeling stirring in my heart. I am afraid
you will have to be a duck, and live a long
time without other ducks, to understand
it. Here were companions, whose natures
and tastes were like mine, and I was
content.</p>

<h2 id="c23">A LOST FLOWER.</h2>
<p>More than a hundred years ago a new
flower was found in the wild and rugged
mountains of North Carolina by Michaux,
a Frenchman, who had traversed
many lands and known many perils and
adventures in his search for rare plants.
He had traveled through his native country
and Spain, climbed the Pyrenees,
crossed sea and desert, been despoiled by
Arab robbers, so that he arrived in Persia
with nothing but his books left to him of
his baggage. Luckily he cured the Shah
of an illness, and was allowed to carry
back to France many Eastern plants. He
was then sent by his country to explore
the forests of North America. In the
mountainous country of North Carolina
there were no roads, only Indian trails,
traversed by a few missionaries and traders.
In this wild and lonely region he
found a new flower, that belonged to no
recognized genus, and was mentioned by
no previous botanist. It was a modest
little flower; its pure white cup rises on
a wand-like stem in the midst of shining
and tender leaves, round in shape and
prettily edged. He secured a specimen,
but he had no leisure to study its habits
in the &ldquo;montagnes sauvages,&rdquo; as he called
these mountains in his own language.
Rumors reached him of the French Revolution,
and he immediately hastened to
return home. He was shipwrecked on
the voyage and lost nearly all his collections.</p>
<p>From this time the flower was lost, so
far as any knowledge of its existence was
concerned. But after the death of Michaux,
our botanist, Dr. Asa Gray, happened
to be in Paris with the son, the
younger Michaux, also a lover of plants.
Very naturally Michaux showed his
American guest his father&rsquo;s new specimens
of American plants that had escaped
the shipwreck, and Dr. Gray was
much interested in this little flower,
marked &ldquo;Unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he returned to the United States
he sought it in vain. All trace seemed
to have disappeared. Year after year
when he heard of anyone going to the
North Carolina mountains he would beg
the person to look for the lost flower.</p>
<p>At last, someone, by chance, found a
blossom, in early spring, growing in a different
locality, and not recognizing its
genus or species, sent it to Dr. Gray, as
one of the highest botanical authorities.</p>
<p>As soon as Dr. Gray saw it he exclaimed,
with delight: &ldquo;Why, this is the
little unknown flower of Michaux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After its strange disappearance of a
century it had again come to light. It has
since been found in various parts of upper
South Carolina, and is now cultivated
by more than one florist and grower
of rare plants. Its leaves are like those
of the southern wild flower, the Galax,
akin to the Pyxie or flowering moss, so
it has been placed in the same family and
named Shortia galacifolia, i. e., with a
leaf like Galax. The first name is given in
honor of Short, the botanist, a lovely way
of keeping alive the remembrance of one
who loved flowers.</p>

<h2 id="c24">THE POLAR BEAR.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Ursus maritimus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Polar Bear is the only aquatic
member of the family being often called
Sea Bear, as the scientific name (Ursus
maritimus) signifies. It is practically
confined to the arctic zone, although various
unwilling visitants have come as far
south as Iceland and Newfoundland on
the floating cakes of ice. In size the
Polar Bear ranks next to the grizzly,
with a doubt, perhaps, in his favor. He
has the longest neck of any bear and finds
it very useful in catching seals and fish
under water. The coat is a silvery or
creamy white, very long and thick, as
might be expected in an animal which
swims about in the Arctic Ocean and
rests upon cakes of ice. The soles of
the feet are very long and are covered
with thick fur, which gives it a large unslippery
surface, and enables it to climb
over ice with facility.</p>
<p>The food of the Polar Bear consists
principally of fish and seals, but the walrus
often falls a prey to his strength and
cunning, and when starved this Bear is
known to eat marine grass in large quantities.
Carcasses stranded on the beach,
dead whales and marine animals afford
him an opportunity to gorge himself to
the utmost and make enough fat to keep
out the chill of arctic waters. So fat
do these great bears become that the
pregnant female is able to bury herself
in the snows of winter and hibernate, at
the same time suckling her cubs until
spring. The males do not hibernate, but
may be seen all winter.</p>
<p>In hunting seals the Polar Bear enters
the water at some distance from where
his prey is basking on the ice and swims
with great rapidity toward it, keeping
well under water and raising the tip of
his nose to the surface at intervals for
breath. At last it rises beneath and in
front of the seal and strikes it where it
lies, or if it escapes into the water, captures
it with ease, for he is a very rapid
and expert diver. One has been known
to dive from a block of ice and capture
a passing salmon as deftly as a kingfisher
catches a minnow.</p>
<p>In Greenland the Polar Bear is known
to swim from island to island along the
shore, eating the eggs and young of the
innumerable birds which nest there.</p>
<p>Jacques Cartier, the French navigator,
in the narrative of his voyage to Newfoundland
in 1534 gives a wonderful account
of the Polar Bear&rsquo;s fondness for
birds and eggs and the efforts which he
will make to procure them. An &ldquo;Island
of Birds&rdquo; was discovered off the coast of
Newfoundland, &ldquo;and albeit the sayd island
be fourteen leagues from the maine-land,
notwithstanding beares come swimming
thither to eat of the sayd birds, and
our men found one there as great as any
cow, and as white as any swan, who in
their presence leapt into the sea, and upon
Whitsun Munday (following our voyage
to the land) we met her by the way,
swimming toward land as swiftly as
we could saile. So soon as we saw her
we pursued her with our boats, and by
maine strength tooke her, whose flesh
was as good to be eaten as the flesh of
a calf of two yeares old.&rdquo; Captain Sabine
reports having seen a Polar Bear swimming
strongly forty miles from land and
with no ice in sight upon which to rest,
so the statement of Cartier is perhaps
true. Very few cows weigh fifteen hundred
pounds, but this is the recorded
weight of Polar Bears, &ldquo;as great as any
cow,&rdquo; killed by whaling crews in the arctic
seas.</p>
<p>In hunting the Polar Bear the Eskimos
usually pursue them with dogs and
having surrounded them, kill them
with spears and harpoons, while they
fight the dogs. In the water the Polar
Bear is generally able to escape by swimming
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
and diving and often it happens
that by his strength and quickness he
overturns boats and mangles the occupants
before they can be rescued. The
skin and fat of the Polar Bear are more
valued by the natives of the north than
his flesh, which is both fibrous and strong
in flavor. The members of various arctic
expeditions have been glad to eat it,
however, Dr. Kane in particular, having
had his life and that of his comrades preserved
for some time by the meat from
the carcass of a great bear, which fell into
a trap baited simply with an old and
greasy stocking. Whenever possible his
men shot the bears on the ice, and many
pathetic scenes were witnessed by them
when the mothers of cubs were killed or
when the cubs being slain, their mother
refused to leave their bodies, even when
wounded. So great is the affection of
these bears for each other that when one
of a pair is killed the mate remains by
the body, fondling and caressing it and
trying to tempt it by food and endearments
to rise again.</p>
<p>It has always been very difficult to
keep Polar Bears in confinement, on account
of the heat and lack of swimming
facilities. The great bears at Bronx
Park in New York City are probably the
happiest in captivity; with a great pool
to swim in, rocks to climb and a deep cave
down into the cool heart of a granite
rock, where they can always retire and
go into cold storage. Their happiness is
largely due to the ingenuity and kindliness
of William T. Hornaday, the director,
who probably understands better
what an animal wants than any man in
America. But after he had provided
everything that a well-regulated bear
might desire, he was distressed to see his
pets idle and sulking, taking no exercise
and declining to utilize any of the facilities
except the cold storage department.
It was at this crisis that Mr. Hornaday
heard from some whalers that in the arctic
lands Polar Bears had been seen to
play with small boulders by the hour. At
once he gave his pets a small boulder
and immediately all changed. They
pushed, they fought and struggled, rolled
the stone up hill and down hill, threw it
into the pool and dived for it&mdash;and have
been happy ever since. They had been
like children in a fine house, but with
nothing to play with.</p>
